# 🚀 Express Middleware Demo (Logging & Authentication)

This project demonstrates the use of **Middleware** in a **Node.js Express** application.  
It includes two common types of middleware:
1. **Logging Middleware** – Logs incoming requests.
2. **Authentication Middleware** – Verifies access tokens for protected routes.
